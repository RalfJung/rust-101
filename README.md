# Rust-101

This documents Rust-101, a tutorial for the [Rust
language](http://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Online tutorial

The most accessible form of the tutorial is its
[online version](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/main.html).

## Offline Usage

You can either read through the sources in `src/`, or generate the
HTML in `docs/` using `make docs`. This steps assumes `pipx install pycco` has
been run before; it will use the pipx-created venv to import pycco.

The files `workspace/src/part*.rs` are generated by `make workspace`.

## Source, License

You can find the sources in the [git
repository](http://www.ralfj.de/git/rust-101.git) (also available [on
